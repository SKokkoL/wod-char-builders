        Regain Willpower when someone realizes for the first time that you are more than
        merely mortal. (M)
</li>
<li>
        Reluctant Supernatural: Garou, vampire, mage, whatever strange thing you are-you don't want to be it. You long for your "normal" life, before whatever changed you into this thing you can't understand.

        so without consequences. (S, MtSC)
</li>
<li>
        Revolutionary: You hold freedom dearly and desire justice, and will do whatever is necessary to hold on to these precious liberties. Unlike the Rebel, your urge is not to resist ALL authority, but rather to fight corruption in the system where you
        find it.
        Regain Willpower when your questioning or resisting leadership or the status quo turns out to be best for you/your party/or those you are trying to protect. (Original; created for my Exalted character)
</li>
<li>
        Rogue: Screw the world! You do what you need to look out for yourself and get done what has to get done. If someone else suffers in the process, that's just too bad.
        Regain Willpower when your self-centered methods gain you something of significant value. (M3)
</li>
<li>

<li>
        Supplicant: Whatever you do, it is in the service of the Divine Being which you honor, fear, and/or love.
        Regain Willpower when you significantly advance the aims of your Benefactor (M:tSC says, "Without endangering yourself in the process," but that doesn't really make sense to me...). Remember, of course, that the deity you follow does not necessarily have to be nice. (S, MtSC)
</li>
<li>
        Survivor: No matter what happens, you'll pull through it somehow. You're one tough cookie, and don't understand it when others give up so easily.
        Regain Willpower when you survive a difficult situation by the skin of your teeth. (G)
</li>
<li>
        Sycophant: You're the perfect yes-man, doing whatever you can to please the more powerful forces that be so they'll protect you. That silly Arab guy from The Mummy is a good example.
        Regain Willpower when you... I dunno, I didn't write it down.
        (VPG2)
</li>
<li>
        Theorist: The world around you is something to try and explain, and your theories drive your purpose for being.
        Regain Willpower when an observation based on your theory comes to pass. This has to be a well-thought-out, complex theory, not something that's already blatantly obvious. (S)
</li>
<li>
        Thrillseeker: The stakes are just never high enough. More adrenaline, please!
        Regain Willpower every time you willingly enter a life-threatening situation and then escape it. (A)
</li>
<li>
        Traditionalist: Why change what's worked for ages? You're the ultimate conservative.
        Regain Willpower when your old-fashioned methods prove to be the best solution. (G)
</li>
<li>
        Trickster: Your antics do more than amuse; your pranks and tricks have a point of teaching someone a lesson, or humorously but deftly reveal some wisdom.
        Regain Willpower when your acts reveal wisdom that would not have been realized by more traditional
        means. (M:tSC)
</li>
<li>
        Visionary: You have the drive and imagination to keep aiming for the sky and beyond.
        Regain Willpower when you convince others to believe in your dreams and follow your vision. (G)
</li>
<li>
        Waif: Whether you are or not, you have the appearance of being innocent and weak, and you haven't quite learned to act on your own without relying on others' pity.
        Regain Willpower when you accomplish something important without anyone's help. (MtSC)
</li>
<li>
        Wanderer: Settling down just is not your thing-whether you're running away from something or simply longing to see new places, the road is your home.
        Regain Willpower when you complete your purpose in one place and move on, leaving no loose ends or attachments behind. (M)
